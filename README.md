# Labrakates

Labrakates is a project to run [InstructLab](https://instructlab.ai/)
in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) using [Tekton
Pipelines](https://tekton.dev/), enabling users to fine-tune large
language models with their own repository of knowledge or skills
within their GPU-enabled Kubernetes clusters.

The name is roughly inspired by the InstructLab labrador combined with
the way some people pronounce the Kubernetes abbreviation "k8s" as
"kates" / "keights".

Please see https://labrakates.github.io/ for details on how to get
started with Labrakates, including installing the Pipelines in your
own cluster as well as example usage.
